              Vernacular architecture is building done outside any academic tradition, and without professional
              guidance. It is not a particular architectural movement or style, but rather a broad category,
              encompassing a wide range and variety of building types, with differing methods of construction, from
              around the world, both historical and extant and classical and modern. Vernacular architecture constitutes
              95% of the world's built environment, as estimated in 1995 by Amos Rapoport, as measured against the small
              percentage of new buildings every year designed by architects and built by engineers.

              This type of architecture usually serves immediate, local needs, is constrained by the materials available
              in its particular region and reflects local traditions and cultural practices. The study of vernacular
              architecture does not examine formally schooled architects, but instead that of the design skills and
              tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular
              architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in an effort to be more energy
              conscious with contemporary design and construction—part of a broader interest in sustainable design.
